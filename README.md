# First-Project

As a user, I want to be able to acess a database (in our example inventory).This would be through a search/sumbit bar. 

As a user I would be able to see the results of that search/spefic information(like product name, amounts and prices), in an area on the screen.

As a user, be able to view selected item or items in a section of the screen with key elements and values shown on screen.

As a user, I want to apply changes to any elements in the database. For example; if we have over-stocked items, apply discounts to these items. 

As a user, I want these changes to be applied on the site, without changing the original database.
